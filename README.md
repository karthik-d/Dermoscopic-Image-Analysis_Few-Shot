- The paper that proposed Relation Networks for Few-Shot Learning

### [[CVPR-2020] Meta-DermDiagnosis Few-Shot Skin Disease Identification using Meta-Learning.pdf](./Literature/%5BCVPR-2020%5D%20Meta-DermDiagnosis%20Few-Shot%20Skin%20Disease%20Identification%20using%20Meta-Learning.pdf)

- Proposes the use of meta-learning techniques for efficient model adaptation for extremely low-data scenarios
- Applies Group equivariant convolutions (G-convolutions) in place of the normal spatial convolution filters
- Two network implementations: 
    - Reptile: Gradient-based meta-learning
    - Prototypical networks using Euclidean Distance
- Evaluated on ISIC 2018, Derm7pt and SD-198 datasets
- Implementation Code NOT available
